# Calculator
this is a calculator made from scratch. It has a simple html and css syntax

it allows to compute the basic algebraic operations (+, -, *, /)

## what I practiced while doing this app

- array methods
- boolean expresions to include functionalities
- arrow functions
- event listeners
- string methods
- if/else & switch
- parsing
